# About The Project

I made this project to get back into web development. I haven't used HTML, CSS and Javascript in years so I wanted to try it out again by making a simple weather app using the Accuweather API.

I wanted to use Three.js with this project but that was a bit too much for this project.

## Tools used

I used the basics for web development, which are HTML and Javascript. For CSS I used TailwindCSS instead.
Like stated before I wanted to use Three.js but that was way out of scope for the project, I also never used it before and making a model for every type of weather was a bit too much for me.

I also used Vite for the development of the app, though i haven't build it.

## How it works

All you have to do is enter the location of your choosing, you can also select if you want it in Metric units or Imperial units.
After you entered your location and chose what unit system you want to use, the app will display the weather at that current time for the location.
It will show the location, the temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on the selected unit system) and the windspeed (in km/h or mp/h).

## Notes

Yes I know the API key is easily accesible i didn't know how to hide the key at the time (still don't).

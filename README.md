# About The Project

I made this project to get back into web development. I haven't used HTML, CSS and Javascript in years so i wanted to try it out again by making a simple weather app using the Accuweather API.

I wanted to use Three.js with this project but that was a bit too much for this project.

## How it works

All you have to do is enter the location of your choosing, you can also select if you want it in Metric units or Imperial units.
After you entered your location and chose what unit system you want to use, the app will display the weather at that current time for the location.
It will show the location, the temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on the selected unit system) and the windspeed (in km/h or mp/h).

## Notes

Yes i know the API key is easily accesible i didn't know how to hide the key at the time (still don't).
